## About the Assigment

This is small project that keeps track of a list of games and its publisher using Laravel as way to showcase a basic CRUD functionality of a database. 

A copy of the database is included in the files.

## Notes

Due to lack of time and unable to debug certain errors, it was not possible to complete all the CRUD functionalities. At the bare mininum what I wanted to showcase were those 2 CRUDs modules however debugging the errors have proved a complex task, and I don't fully understand where the issues are located.

Would have honestly loved to understand a bit more regarding these errors, and how all the elements fully connect as I'm not completely sure where some files/locations are and how everything comes together.
